### (#82 - ) Section 10: Motion in ROS

Motion is described by the `Twist` message. However for 2D non-holonomic robots you only need `linear.x` (speed) and `angular.z` (omega around z-axis)

Note: All values are by default 0 unless specified otherwise

Example application: cleaning robot. Divide and conquer strategy: develop several simple methods then integrate all. Four elementary trajectories:

1. Motion in straight line (forward and backward). `linear.x = CONSTANT_SPEED`

```
Linear:
    x: CONSTANT_SPEED
    y: 0
    z: 0
Angular:
    x: 0
    y: 0
    z: 0
```

2. Rotation in place (clockwise and counter-clockwise) `angular.z = CONSTANT_SPEED`

```
Linear:
	x: 0
	y: 0
	z: 0
Angular:
	x: 0
	y: 0
	z: CONSTANT_SPEED
```

3. Go to goal `linear.x = PID(distance)`, `angular.z = PID(delta_orientation)`  

```
Linear:
	x: PID(distance_to_goal)
	y: 0
	z: 0
Angular:
	x: 0
	y: 0
	z: PID(delta_orientation)
```

4. Spiral `linear.x = f(time)`, `angular.z = CONSTANT_SPEED`  

```
Linear:
	x: f(time)
	y: 0
	z: 0
Angular:
	x: 0
	y: 0
	z: CONSTANT_SPEED
```

5. integrate all in a cleaning application

Launch `turtlesim` and inspect topics and messages

```bash
$ roscore
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node 
$ rostopic list
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/turtle1/cmd_vel
/turtle1/color_sensor
/turtle1/pose

$ rostopic info /turtle1/cmd_vel
Type: geometry_msgs/Twist

Publishers: None

Subscribers: 
 * /turtlesim (http://mhered-laptop:43561/)

$ rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist
geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z

```

Pose topic captures location orientation and velocity in 2D

```bash
$ rostopic info turtle1/pose
Type: turtlesim/Pose

Publishers: 
 * /turtlesim (http://mhered-laptop:43561/)

Subscribers: None

$ rosmsg show turtlesim/Pose
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta
float32 linear_velocity
float32 angular_velocity

```

x, y are spatial coordinates

theta is yaw (orientation around z with origin in x axis

`Pose.linear_velocity` = `Twist.linear.x`

`Pose.angular_velocity` = `Twist.angular.z`

Import libraries:

```python
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
from turtlesim.msg import Pose
```

###  (#87) Straight motion

from x0, y0 to x,y

Write `move()`

Date 15.11

### Cleaning app

#### Create package

```bash
~/catkin_ws/src$ catkin_create_pkg cleaning_robot std_msgs rospy roscpp
Created file cleaning_robot/package.xml
Created file cleaning_robot/CMakeLists.txt
Created folder cleaning_robot/include/cleaning_robot
Created folder cleaning_robot/src
Successfully created files in /home/mhered/catkin_ws/src/cleaning_robot. Please adjust the values in package.xml.

```

#### Not Needed: Update dependencies in `CMakeLists.txt`

In `~/catkin_ws/src/cleaning_app/CMakeLists.txt`: 

1. in `find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS`add add the library  `message_generation` to the list of dependencies 
2. in the entry `catkin_package`, add `message_runtime` to `CATKIN_DEPENDS` 
3. activate the entry `generate_messages` and list there dependencies of the generated messages, e.g. if the _fieldtypes_ include previously created messages in other packages. 

#### Not Needed: Update dependencies in `package.xml`

1. in the manifest `~/catkin_ws/src/mhered/package.xml` add the following lines in the appropriate places to update dependencies:
   1. `<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>` and 
   2. `<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>`

#### Compile

```bash
~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make
```

Write `move()`



----

Date: 16.11

(#89 - 107)

Finish `rotate()`, `go_to()`

Read about `set_orientation()` and `spiral()`

Read about launch files



----

Date: 17.11

Write `spiral()`,  `set_orientation()` , integration in  `cleaner()`

#### Launch files (#107, #109)

* XML files

* specify nodes and their parameters

* can include existing launch files

* run with `roslaunch`

* by convention `.launch` extension

  

created launch file `cleaner.launch`:

```xml
<launch>
	<node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="my_turtle" />
	<node pkg="cleaning_robot" type="cleaner_robot.py" name="cleaner_node" />
</launch>
	
```

* `pkg` package

* `type` node name

* `name` custom name

Can be launched with `$ roslaunch cleaning_robot cleaner.launch` Does not require to run `roscore` or open several terminals. Has autocomplete. Need to provide <package-name>, not folder

Can define parameters and launch othe launch files:

### Read (#108) Network config but didn't understand it

### Skipped also (#109-#110)

---

Date: 25.11

### Install Turtlebot3 (#111-#112)

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

From `~/catkin_ws/src/` issue `git clone` to download the core **Turtlebot3** packages:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git -b noetic-devel
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3-.git -b noetic-devel
```

Issue `$ catkin_make` from `~/catkin_ws/` to compile. 

**After compilation**, download simulation packages: from `~/catkin_ws/src/`issue:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git -b noetic-devel
```

Again, issue `$ catkin_make` from `~/catkin_ws/` to compile. 

Edit`~/.bashrc` (if notalready done) so last lines are:

```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source /home/mhered/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

```

`export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle` to set the default robot (can be also `burger`)

`export SVGA_VGPU10=0` to avoid crashing when opening gazebo in virtual machine

Recommended also to add aliases in the proper section for convenience:

```
alias burger='export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger'
alias waffle='export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle'
alias tb3fake='roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch'
alias tb3teleop='roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch'
alias tb3='roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch'
alias tb3maze='roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch'
alias tb3house='roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch'
```

E.g. to control robot with keys in a maze world visualizing RVIZ (lidar + camera):

Terminal 1:`$ tb3maze`

Terminal 2:`$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch`

Terminal 3:`$ tb3teleop`

![Screenshot from 2021-11-26 01-31-33](./assets/images/Screenshot_2021-11-26_01-31-33.png)

E.g. SLAM for MAP building:

Terminal 1:`$ roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmappping`

Terminal 2:`$ tb3teleop`

### To do Turtlebot3 DEMO : #113
