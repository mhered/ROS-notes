### (#036-49) TF package

TF: transformation library in ROS

Performs the computations for transformations between frames, allowing to compute the pose of any object in any frame. Also provides an API for python and C++ to publish and listen to frames in ROS.

ROS convention for axes: X: red. Y: Green, Z: Blue

A robot is defined as collection of frames attached to its different joints and components. URDF: unified robot description format, XML file that describes the robot, see http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials

Some ROS nodes in TF package that provide utilities:

#### `view_frames` 

Graphical debugging tool that saves in PDF a graph of the current full tree of transform frames

Formerly `$ rosrun tf view_frames`,  it is deprecated in **ROS Noetic**. We need to install the package `tf2_tools` with:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-tf2-tools
```

Then run it with:

```
$ rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py
```

Typical usage is to generate the PDF then view it, e.g. on standard PDF visor  `evince`:

```
$ evince frames.pdf
```

Hence it is useful to add the following shortcut to `.bashrc`.

(**ROS Noetic** version):

```
alias tf='cd /var/tmp && rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py && evince frames.pdf &'
```

Note the tree starts with:

* `map` global frame

* `odom` frame relative to odometry

* `base_footprint` attached to the base of the robot at its centre



#### `tf_monitor`

Monitor transforms between frames

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_monitor <source frame> <target frame>
```

Without parameters shows all transformations:

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_monitor
```

#### `tf_echo`

Prints to screen the specified transform between any two frames

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_echo <source frame> <target frame> <broadcast freq in Hz>
```

Provides translation and rotation (in quaternion, RPY (roll-pitch-yaw))

#### `static_transform_publisher`

Command line tool to send static transforms:

```bash
$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher <t_x> <t_y> <t_z> <yaw> <roll> <pitch> <parent frame> <frame_2> <broadcast freq in Hz>
```

(t_x t_y t_z) is the translation vector

Note order of Euler angles is YRP

Example:

```bash
$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 1 2 3 0.1 0.2 0.3 frame_a frame_b 10
```

The same through a launch file:

```xml
<launch>
	<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="frame_a to frame_b"
	args="1 2 3 0.1 0.2 0.3 frame_a frame_b 10" />
</launch>
```



#### See also

*  `rqt_tf_tree` that allows dynamic introspection of the tree
* `roswtf`: with the `tfwtf` plugin helps debug `tf` issues

### 

Convention: TF methods use angles in radians

```python
import math
import tf

roll = math.radians(25.0)
pitch = math.radians(30.0)
yaw = math.radians(45.0)

quaternion = tf.transformations.quaternion_from_euler(roll, pitch, yaw)
rpy = tf.transformations.euler_from_quaternion(quaternion)
roll=math.degrees(rpy[0])
pitch=math.degrees(rpy[1])
yaw=math.degrees(rpy[2])
```

Two topics represent robot location and orientation:

`/odom` (re. odometry)

uses `nav_msgs/OdometryMessage`  messages including a `Header`, a `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance` (position, orientation represented by a quaternion and covariances) and a `geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance`(linear velocities, angular velocities and covariances)

 `/acml_pose` (global location re. `map` frame)

uses `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped` messages ingluding a `Header` and a `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance` (position, orientation represented by a quaternion and covariances )

### Testing TF on the minipupper

Launch the Mini Pupper driver:

```bash
Terminal 1:$ roslaunch mini_pupper_config bringup.launch rviz:=true
```

And the teleop node on a second terminal:

```bash
Terminal 2:$ roslaunch champ_teleop teleop.launch
```

Lets see the frames in action. In **RVIZ**: 

* Global Options -> Background Color -> choose dark color

* Robot Model -> Alpha -> 0.5

* TF -> Show Names -> tick; Show Axes -> tick; Show Arrows -> untick

* TF -> Frames -> tick only odom, base, one leg, cameras and hokuyo

$ evince frames.pdf &
```

Monitor the frames

```bash

Check one transformation in particular:

...
RESULTS: for /odom to /base_link

```

And the actual values, changing as you move the robot:

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_echo odom base_link 1 
At time 1642291616.111
- Translation: [1.718, 0.015, 0.045]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, -0.225, 0.974]
            in RPY (radian) [0.000, 0.000, -0.453]
            in RPY (degree) [0.000, 0.000, -25.978]
