## Section 9 (#71-76): Reactive Navigation
Different type of navigation without a map or knowing location in global frame.

We already developed go-to-goal behavior in open space without obstacles: Location of goal is expressed relative to current robot position because there is no global frame. To generate control signals we use a PID controller.

Go-to-goal + obstacle avoidance is more complex. We also need the robot to take decisions when an obstacle is detected.

### (#72) Follower app
1. Create a TF broadcaster: node that publishes a frame

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rospy
import tf
from turtlesim.msg import Pose


def pose_callback(pose_msg, turtlename):
    """ """
    # create a transform broadcaster
    transform_broadcaster = tf.TransformBroadcaster()

    # obtain orientation quaternion from 2D Pose msg in degrees
    rotation_quaternion = tf.transformations.quaternion_from_euler(
        0, 0, pose_msg.theta)

    # assemble translation vector from 2D Pose msg
    translation_vector = [pose_msg.x, pose_msg.y, 0]

    # obtain time stamp
    time_stamp = rospy.Time.now()

    # publish transform between turtle frame and world
    # args: (translation, quaternion, time stamp, child frame, parent frame)
    transform_broadcaster.sendTransform(translation_vector,
                                        rotation_quaternion, time_stamp,
                                        turtlename+"_frame", "world")


if __name__ == '__main__':

    # init code
    rospy.init_node('turtle_tf_broadcaster')

    # get param from launch file
    turtlename = rospy.get_param('~turtle')

    # subscribe to the Pose topic
    rospy.Subscriber('/%s/pose' % turtlename, Pose, pose_callback, turtlename)
    rospy.spin()
```

2. Assign a TF broadcaster to each turtlesim

Launch file:
```xml
<launch>

    <!-- launch turtlesim simulator node -->
    <!-- spawns the leader turtle and calls it turtle1 -->

    <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="sim"/>

    <!-- launch teleop node -->
    <!-- How does teleop get assigned to turtle1? -->
    <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtle_teleop_key" name="teleop" output="screen"/>

    <!-- launch a tf broadcaster for the leader turtle -->
    <node pkg="mhered" type="tf_broadcaster.py" name="turtle1_tf_broadcaster"
        respawn="false" output="screen">
        <param name="turtle" type="string" value="turtle1" />
    </node>

    <!-- launch a tf broadcaster for the follower turtle -->
    <node pkg="mhered" type="tf_broadcaster.py" name="turtle_follower_tf_broadcaster"
        respawn="false" output="screen">
        <param name="turtle" type="string" value="turtle_follower" />
    </node>

    <!-- launch listener node -->
    <node pkg="mhered" type="tf_listener.py" name="listener"/>

</launch>

```

3. Create a TF listener
       * get the transformation between the two frames
           * extract distance and orientation
           * Use go-to-goal to make follower move towards leader

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rospy
import math
import tf
import turtlesim.msg
import geometry_msgs.msg
import turtlesim.srv


if __name__ == "__main__":

    # init node
    rospy.init_node("turtle_tf_listener")

    # create a new transform listener
    transform_listener = tf.TransformListener()

    # spawn the follower turtlesim
    rospy.wait_for_service('spawn')
    spawner = rospy.ServiceProxy('spawn', turtlesim.srv.Spawn)
    spawner(4, 2, 0, 'turtle_follower')

    turtle_follower_vel = rospy.Publisher(
        'turtle_follower/cmd_vel', geometry_msgs.msg.Twist, queue_size=1)

    rate = rospy.Rate(10.0)

    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        try:
            (translation, rotation) = transform_listener.lookupTransform(
                '/turtle_follower_frame', '/turtle1_frame', rospy.Time(0))
        except (tf.LookupException,
                tf.ConnectivityException, tf.ExtrapolationException):
            continue

        # relative coordinates of follower in turtle1_frame
        x = translation[0]
        y = translation[1]

        angular_vel = 4 * math.atan2(y, x)
        linear_vel = 0.5 * math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)

        cmd = geometry_msgs.msg.Twist()
        cmd.linear.x = linear_vel
        cmd.angular.z = angular_vel

        turtle_follower_vel.publish(cmd)

        rate.sleep()
```

### Bug algorithms

Strategies to navigate without a global map in the presence of obstacles. Only information is coming from sensors.
#### Bug 0
2 states or behaviors:

* Behavior 1: move straight towards the goal
* Behaviour 2: follow obstacle boundary
* Algorithm
        * Repeat
                * Behavior 1 until obstacle detected
                * Behavior 2 until no obstacle in direction of the goal
                No guarantee to reach the destination

#### Bug 1
3 states or behaviors:

* Behavior 1: move straight towards the goal
* Behavior 2: follow obstacle boundary, tour around it and note the location closest to the goal
* Behavior 3: use wall following to return to point closest to goal 
* Algorithm
  * Repeat
    * Behavior 1 until obstacle detected
    * Behavior 2 until turn completed
    * Behavior 3 until closest point reached

Slower but better guarantees

#### Bug 2

2 states or behaviors:

* Behavior 1: move straight towards the goal
* Behavior 2: follow obstacle boundary
* Algorithm
  * Repeat 
    * Behavior 1 until obstacle detected
    * Behavior 2 until intersection with original trajectory

Best performance

### ## Assignment 2

Implement BUG0 algorithm in ROS

1. Run **Turtlebot 3** simulator with:

``` bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_4.launch
```

2. Start RVIZ with:

``` bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
```

Laser scanner topic is shown as small red dots in RVIZ. You can change the attributes: Color to Green and Size (m) to 0.05. 

We could reuse here node `scan_subscriber.py` subscribes to the Laserscan: 

```bash
$ rosrun mhered scan_publisher.py
```

Run `teleop` and make the robot move around to see how the laser scanner topic changes:

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch 
```

Find the location of the red circle with respect to the robot position: **Approx. (2.8, 0, 0)**

3. develop the `go_straight()` behavior and the `follow_wall()` behavior 
4. make the robot reach the destination. 

You need to use the laser scanner data to calculate the distance to the obstacles and use a threshold value to switch between the two behaviors. e.g. condition in Assignment 7 of course 1 was: obstacle closer than 0.6 meters in a laser beam of  [-5,+5] degrees around the center.

---

Repeat:

* move straight towards the goal until obstacle detected
* follow obstacle boundary until no obstacle in direction of the goal
  No guarantee to reach the destination
