# Assignment 5

Develop a Python script that implements the turtlesim cleaning application discussed in the lecture. 

Include methods `move`, `rotate` etc with their appropriate parameters. 

Present a menu with two options:

1- spiral cleaning 

2- grid cleaning

Submit a zip folder containing:

1. `clean.py`: Python script of the cleaning application
2. `clean_py.launch`, a launch file that starts the `turtlesim` node and the `clean.py` script both together

Submission: [ZIP file](./assets/sources/clean.zip)

## Potential Improvements 

- [ ] command to abort cleaning and resume
- [ ] rename parameters to specify angles are in degrees



Remember convention: 

clockwise = to the right = positive angle

anticlockwise = to the left = negative angle
