### (#036-49) TF package

TF: transformation library in ROS

Performs the computations for transformations between frames, allowing to compute the pose of any object in any frame. Also provides an API for python and C++ to publish and listen to frames in ROS.

ROS convention for axes: X: red. Y: Green, Z: Blue

A robot is defined as collection of frames attached to its different joints and components. URDF: unified robot description format, XML file that describes the robot, see http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials

Some ROS nodes in TF package that provide utilities:

#### `view_frames` 

Graphical debugging tool that saves in PDF a graph of the current full tree of transform frames

Formerly `$ rosrun tf view_frames`,  it is deprecated in **ROS Noetic**. We need to install the package `tf2_tools` with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-tf2-tools
```

Then run it with:

```bash
$ rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py
```

Typical usage is to generate the PDF then view it, e.g. on standard PDF visor  `evince`:

```bash
$ evince frames.pdf
```

Hence it is useful to add the following shortcut to `.bashrc`.

(**ROS Noetic** version):

```bash
alias tf='cd /var/tmp && rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py && evince frames.pdf &'
```

1. Launch Turtlebot3 in gazebo:

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch
```

This creates:

* `/odom` frame relative to odometry

* `/base_footprint` frame attached to the base of the robot at its centre

<img src="assets/images/gazebo_only.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

2. Then also launch RVIZ:

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch 
```

This loads turtlebot3 URDF file with all the frames:

<img src="assets/images/gazebo_and_rviz.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

3. Close RVIZ (2) and with Turtlebot3 still running in gazebo (1) launch the navigation stack module with:

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=/home/mhered/catkin_ws/src/ros_course_part2/src/topic03_map_navigation/tb3map/tb3_house_map.yaml
```

Note the navigation stack module loads a `/map` frame as parent of `/odom` 

`/map` is needed for any map-based navigation mission

<img src="assets/images/gazebo_and_navstack.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

`/amcl_pose` message location of robot wrt `/map` frame

```bash
$ rostopic echo /amcl_pose
header: 
  seq: 1
  stamp: 
    secs: 635
    nsecs: 810000000
  frame_id: "map"

  pose: 
    position: 
      x: -2.978668827422152
      y: 0.9827583256793712
      z: 0.0
    orientation: 
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      z: -0.006352050488201943
      w: 0.9999798255237929
  covariance: [0.19066007012963837, -3.7294368260720745e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.7294368260720745e-05, 0.15981096658104488, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05891328333050745]
---
```

Note: x, y, z, and quaternion in /map frame 

`/odom` message



Note the tree starts with:

* `map` global frame

* `odom` frame relative to odometry

* `base_footprint` attached to the base of the robot at its centre

#### `tf_echo`

Prints to screen the specified transform between any two frames

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_echo <source frame> <target frame> <broadcast freq in Hz>
```

Provides translation and rotation (in quaternion, RPY (roll-pitch-yaw))

Example:

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_echo map odom
Failure at 835.758000000
Exception thrown:"map" passed to lookupTransform argument target_frame does not exist. 
The current list of frames is:
Frame base_link exists with parent base_footprint.
Frame camera_depth_frame exists with parent camera_link.
Frame camera_link exists with parent base_link.
Frame camera_depth_optical_frame exists with parent camera_depth_frame.
Frame camera_rgb_frame exists with parent camera_link.
Frame camera_rgb_optical_frame exists with parent camera_rgb_frame.
Frame caster_back_left_link exists with parent base_link.
Frame caster_back_right_link exists with parent base_link.
Frame imu_link exists with parent base_link.
Frame base_scan exists with parent base_link.

...
```



#### `tf_monitor`

Monitor transforms between frames

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_monitor <source frame> <target frame>
```

Without parameters shows all transformations:

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_monitor
```

Example:

```bash
$ rosrun tf tf_monitor odom base_footprint 
Waiting for transform chain to become available between odom and base_footprint 


RESULTS: for odom to base_footprint
Chain is: odom -> base_footprint
Net delay     avg = 0.0034023: max = 0.033

Frames:
Frame: base_footprint published by unknown_publisher Average Delay: 0.001 Max Delay: 0.001
Frame: odom published by unknown_publisher Average Delay: -0.483 Max Delay: 0

All Broadcasters:
Node: unknown_publisher 76.9231 Hz, Average Delay: -0.0356154 Max Delay: 0.003
Node: unknown_publisher(static) 1e+08 Hz, Average Delay: 0 Max Delay: 0
...
```





#### `static_transform_publisher`

Command line tool to publish static transforms:

```bash
$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher <t_x> <t_y> <t_z> <yaw> <roll> <pitch> <frame_a> <frame_b> <broadcast freq in Hz>
```

(t_x t_y t_z) is the translation vector

**Note order of Euler angles is yaw roll pitch**

Example. We stop everything and launch a new `roscore`:

```bash
(Terminal 1):$ roscore
-
(Terminal 2):$ rostopic list
/rosout
/rosout_agg
```

Create and publish a transformation between two frames and now we have `/tf` topics

```bash
(Terminal 3):$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 1 2 3 0.1 0.2 0.3 frame_a frame_b 10
-
(Terminal 2):$ rostopic list
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/tf
```

we can view the resulting diagram:

```bash
(Terminal 2):$ rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py
[INFO] [1648235478.467274]: Listening to tf data during 5 seconds...
[INFO] [1648235483.479222]: Generating graph in frames.pdf file...
(Terminal 2):$ evince frames.pdf&
```

<img src="assets/images/static_transform.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Or inspect the transformation with `tf_echo` or `tf_monitor`

Publishing a transform through a launch file `static_transform_publisher` **(Note order x, y, z, yaw, roll, pitch)**: 

```xml
<launch>
	<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" 
          name="frame_a to frame_b"
          args="1 2 3 0.1 0.2 0.3 frame_a frame_b 10" />
</launch>
```

Saved as  `~/catkin_ws/src/mhered/src/static_transform_publisher.launch` and run it with:

```bash
$ roslaunch mhered static_transform_publisher.launch
```

#### See also

*  `rqt_tf_tree` that allows dynamic introspection of the tree
* `roswtf`: with the `tfwtf` plugin helps debug `tf` issues



Convention: TF methods use angles in radians

```python
import math
import tf

roll = math.radians(25.0)
pitch = math.radians(30.0)
yaw = math.radians(45.0)

quaternion = tf.transformations.quaternion_from_euler(roll, pitch, yaw)
rpy = tf.transformations.euler_from_quaternion(quaternion)
roll = math.degrees(rpy[0])
pitch = math.degrees(rpy[1])
yaw = math.degrees(rpy[2])
```

Two topics represent robot location and orientation:

`/odom` (re. odometry)

uses `nav_msgs/OdometryMessage`  messages including a `Header`, a `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance` (position, orientation represented by a quaternion and covariances) and a `geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance`(linear velocities, angular velocities and covariances)

 `/acml_pose` (global location re. `map` frame)

uses `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped` messages ingluding a `Header` and a `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance` (position, orientation represented by a quaternion and covariances )

### (#50) Python node that publishes a transformation between parent `frame_a` and child `frame_b`

**Note: I removed python is python3 package (what? why?) and now this node didn't work until I replaced `#!/usr/bin/env python` by `#!/usr/bin/env python3`. Need to review previous code as well!!**

            rotation_quaternion,
            current_time,
            "frame_b", "frame_a")  # child frame, parent frame
        time.sleep(0.5)  # frequency: we publish every .5 sec i.e. 2Hz

### Testing TF on the minipupper

Launch the Mini Pupper driver:

```bash
Terminal 1:$ roslaunch mini_pupper_config bringup.launch rviz:=true
```

And the teleop node on a second terminal:

```bash
Terminal 2:$ roslaunch champ_teleop teleop.launch
```

Lets see the frames in action. In **RVIZ**: 

* Global Options -> Background Color -> choose dark color

* Robot Model -> Alpha -> 0.5

* TF -> Show Names -> tick; Show Axes -> tick; Show Arrows -> untick

* TF -> Frames -> tick only odom, base, one leg, cameras and hokuyo
